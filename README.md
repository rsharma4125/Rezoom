SOME REQUIREMENTS-
	Here we are using TIKA library in this python web application, TIKA lib is developed 
	by APACHE servers which is basically developed for java and we are using this in 
	python environment, it is some time required to have java installed in the server
	machine. Although here java have no functionality still it is required for the 
	working. OTHERWISE it will generate messeges like "File is not supported"
